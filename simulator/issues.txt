* run many experiments
* working with first  greedy plan tends to be better than spending an extended time planning (eg 30s).
* make javascript libraries available offline (google and jquery)
* get uni machine running continuous integration server -- running experiments from lastest git push
* Test move finishing at end of plan has its corresponding observe action applied
* refine logging output
* write tests for executor and new simulator
* remove simulator and refactor new_simulator as simulator

done
----
* need to make sure temp nodes are removed correctly
* make sure timeline is giving correct colours to actions
* unit tests
* avoid partial actions with zero duration
* split ExtraCleans in timeline
* add failed plan action
* add stalled action to check agents are correctly executing
* convert print statements to logging
* add total ordering to actions, don't rely on tuple ordering for execution queue...
* resolve source problems with liclipse
* add base package to project and main module
* remove debug from action -- make permanent
* refactor simulator and run_simulation into a class and additional methods
* try to split simulator and executor
* make unit machine self-maintained ubuntu
* make actions use __eq__ and remove matchers
