# Job list

* executor does not respond to events that make more goals solvable
  * For instance: if the time to rescue a civilian was overestimated, when overestimate is discovered then executor only cares that it can still achieve all its assigned goals
  
* optic cannot deal with very high metric values. eg. 3e6 and above -- actual limit not known
