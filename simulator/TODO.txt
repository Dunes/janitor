	# -- only replan on plan invalidation (because of new knowledge) ### BINGO
		# done via changing problems so only get new knowledge when visiting extra dirty rooms

# Maybe a good idea to go into debug mode when stall instead of just quiting?


* Get planner running on big domains in cloud

* get simulator working with roborescue again (is it broken, I don't know)
* rerun problem in cloud

* add third domain to decentralised planner
* run problems in cloud



-- run problems on new code
-- run problems on centralised planner code
-- see what the best allocate and local plan times are
-- compare against centralised planner that replans on new knowledge
-- What about when we get new knowledge (just for Extra Dirty tasks)

-- get new domain from Rovatos working compare and contrast (on both centralised and decentralised)

-- how many problems is good enough?
